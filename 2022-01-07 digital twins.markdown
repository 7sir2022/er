MIT Technology Review published an article yesterday analyzing the impact of digital twins on manufacturing.
Digital twins refers to digital simulations of products in the digital world. It allows companies to identify and solve problems with prototypes before they enter mass production.
>**A prototype** is a model of a new technology before it is put into mass production, to check the quality of the product and to ensure proper operation. It is widely used in electronics, mechanical engineering, vehicle engineering, construction engineering, etc. Experimental products are accordingly called prototypes, prototype cars, etc.

According to [analysis by Yuquan Wang, partner at Haiyin Capital](https://posts.careerengine.us/p/61a020150dbbae169c23ea5c), the digital twins "can simulate the operation of hardware in a highly simulated virtual environment, so that it can test different kinds of changes and then optimize them according to the results." It can fundamentally solve the problems of manageable and controllable manufacturing, quality improvement and price reduction, and personalized manufacturing.
The market for digital-twin technology is $3.1 billion in 2020, growing at a rate of 58 percent per year to 4.8 billion by 2026.
The predecessor of digital-twin technology was CAD technology (computer-aided design) 30 years ago. Today, because of the increase in computer computing power and storage capacity, the ability to digitally simulate products has also increased so much that it is now possible to simulate how products work in the field.
Digital-twin techology has swept through a variety of industries. The adoption of this technology by aerospace companies, automotive manufacturing companies and urban planning agencies can shorten the design and development cycle. The automotive manufacturing industry used to have a product development cycle of 6-8 years, while today it only takes 18-24 months. Startups can also use it to rapidly iterate on their products. Some companies are even planning to skip the step of building prototypes and go directly to the mass production stage.
